# Overview

This software as an arduino program is creating a PID feedback loop that will help
control the chassis. This includes knowing how far it's gone with the sensors called encoders.

My purpose for creating this is to progress the big project of my robot. This is a good step in the right direction of later controlling the chassis of the robot and more.

# Development Environment

The tools I used are git, Arduino IDE, ROS Noetic SDK, and the Linux OS.

The programming language I used for this was C ++, which is the language used for the Arduino IDE.
